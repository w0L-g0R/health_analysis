Key Architecture Points:

    Domain-Specific Brokers:
        Each domain (meals, health, supps) has its own broker and is responsible for specific tasks such as inserting or updating records.
        Each broker is launched as a separate process, which allows for horizontal scaling and fault isolation.

    Task-Oriented Event Handling:
        Tasks are domain-specific and tied to event types (e.g., an insert-meal event triggers an insert-meal task).
        Tasks are injected with necessary dependencies (validators, database connections, gRPC clients) via dependency injection.

    EventBus Client:
        The app or main process runs a client that listens to the EventStoreDB, directing domain-specific events to the appropriate brokers.
        The EventBus client sends the events to the corresponding TaskIQ broker for processing based on the event type.

    Dependency Injection:
        Each broker has its own container, injecting necessary services (like database connections and validators) into the task's context when it is initialized.
        The DI framework is responsible for setting up domain-specific configurations and objects, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns.

Process Workflow:

    main.py Process:
        Responsible for starting the EventBus client.
        Listens for all events and dispatches them to the appropriate broker based on event types.
        Injects the appropriate DI container for each domain during broker startup.

    Domain Broker Processes:
        Each broker (e.g., meals-broker, health-broker) runs in its own process and handles tasks like inserting, updating, or deleting domain-specific entities.
        Tasks are executed by workers, with context set via dependency injection.
